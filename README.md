# Minimal ToDo service example
Minimal ToDo service example, created for the SingapRussian HRTech job interview

## Usage

`./go.sh unit` - runs unit tests    
`./go.sh start_local` - pulls, builds, and runs containerized server (see http://localhost:8080)    
`./go.sh stop_local` - stops containers    

## Open API docs
See `openapi.yml` for the spec

### Note
I got a little carried away with extra tasks, so I didn't quite finish it, especially the tests. But I hope that the train of thought is clear.
